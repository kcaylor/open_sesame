title: "Openness Classifier: Few-shot LLM Classification of Data/Code Availability"
abstract: >-
  A Python library for classifying the openness of data and code
  availability statements in scholarly publications using few-shot
  learning with large language models. Supports multiple LLM providers
  (Claude, OpenAI, Ollama) and produces validation metrics suitable
  for manuscript reporting.
